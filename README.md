Simple recipes for a simple man.

## Meat

### Brined pork chops
* 3 cups water
* 3 tablespoons salt
* 2 cloves garlic, smashed
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 porkchops

Put a cast iron skillet in the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.

Boil 1 cup of water and dissolve three tablespoons salt. Remove from stove and add 2 cups of cold water.

Place porkchops in a pan, cover with the brine, and add garlic. Let porkchops refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Remove chops from fridge and pat dry. Coat with oil, and season to taste.

Remove cast iron skillet from oven, and place on a medium-high stove burner. Sear chops for 2-3 minutes per side.

Put cast iron skillet and chops back in oven for 6 to 10 minutes, or until the porkchops reach 145 degrees.
